\chapter{Implementation}\label{cha:implementation}

This chapter will go into more detail about how we built the system. Here we will describe the decisions made, and reflect on the outcome.

We chose to make the game and drivers in C++ because we wanted to make use of the templating features in the language as a means of abstracting away specific details about our drivers/game. Thereby creating a more general implementation. 

Templating also gives us the advantage of eradicating run-time checks, that could have been done on compile-time. Thereby remove some performance overhead.
