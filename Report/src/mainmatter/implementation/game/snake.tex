\subsection{Snake}

The Snake class is used to keep information about where the Snakes head and tail are, which direction it is currently going, and if it has to grow next time it moves.

The head and tail is simple pointers to a Field. The direction is to know which way the snake is going, in case the player doesn't give an input. \texttt{missing\_growth} is used to keep info about when the snake has to grow, and how much.
