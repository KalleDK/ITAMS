\subsection{Field}

When the Snake moves around it moves onto Fields. A Field can be either a Snake, None, Border or Fruit. To keep the Field's footprint small we use a uin8\_t to keep both the type and the values. So to correctly get the information from a Field, you first have to get the Type Id and then the appropriate function to get the values

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Getting Correct Data From a Field},label={lst:get_snake},frame=tlrb, language=C++]{Name}
if (field->get_id() == type_id::Snake) {
    snake_value tmp = field->get_snake();
    // Do Stuff
}
\end{lstlisting}

This is implemented by simply letting the first 4 bits being the type id and the next 4 the values from this type.

So when you want to set a Field to a fruit you use the set\_fruit method. This in turns calls the set method that is private (see Listing~\ref{lst:set_fruit}). This is to ensure that you can't by accident create a Field with a Snake Type Id, but a Fruit's value.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Updating a Field},label={lst:set_fruit},frame=tlrb, language=C++]{Name}
public:
void set_fruit(fruit_value value) {
    set(type_id::Fruit, static_cast<uint8_t>(value));
}
private:
void set(type_id id, uint8_t value) {
		data = value << 4 | static_cast<uint8_t>(id);
}
\end{lstlisting}
