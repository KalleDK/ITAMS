\chapter{Architecture}

% The system architecture and user interface has to be clearly defined.
We have defined three blocks that outlines our system, as seen in the Block Definition Diagram in Figure~\ref{fig:bdd}. The official responsibilities of the blocks in Figure~\ref{fig:bdd} is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Mega32}: Runs the game, processes input from the controller and draws game on the display.
	\item \textbf{Display}: Displays the game.
	\item \textbf{Controller}: Controls the game.
\end{itemize}
