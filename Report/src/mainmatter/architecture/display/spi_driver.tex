\subsection{SPI driver}

The SPI interface of the ATmega32 is pretty straight forward. There is a few parameters, we need to keep in mind:

\begin{itemize}
\item SPI mode
\item Clock frequency
\item Endianness
\end{itemize}

These properties will have to match the properties defined in the data sheet of the Display. The implementation will be described in Chapter~\ref{cha:implementation}.
