\subsection{Display driver}

The display driver is using the SPI driver for communicating with the display. 

This driver handles the trivial setup of the screen, so it can be used without further setup by the other modules in our system.

This driver implements the different display functions, and makes them available for use, such as setting the X and Y address and changing addressing mode. 

The driver, also, controls the \texttt{Reset} and \texttt{Data/Control} connections to ensure the correct usage.

The implementation will be described in Chapter~\ref{cha:implementation}.
