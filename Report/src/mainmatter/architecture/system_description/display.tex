We've chosen to interface with the display using SPI...

\subsection{Display - PD8544}

Since we are using the nokia 3310 display in our project we needed to write a driver to interface with the chip on the display.
The chip on the display is a PD8544, and we have used to datasheet to figure out how to interface with it. 

The PD8544 uses a serial interface for both control and data, to select whether we are sending control commands or data to the display,
there is a input that needs to be high for data and low for commands.

Since we have a serial interface there is also a serial clock pin, a serial data in pin and a serial clock enable pin.
There is also a pin that is used to reset the display and put it into a known state.

Since the chips interface is serial we decided to use the MEGA32's Serial Pheriphial interface, we are only able to send data to the display 
and cannot receive so we only have use for the master out slave in pin, and not the master ind slave out pin. 

To start the display driver off we decided to write a SPI driver to handle the setup of clock rate, SPI mode and endianess.
