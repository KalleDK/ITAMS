\subsection{Controller driver}

To make it easier to read the controller, we a made a simple driver that uses the software SPI driver to read the states of the buttons. As it's a one-way read communication, it simply reads and parses the signal, and set the different button value accordingly.

The implementation will be described in Chapter~\ref{cha:implementation}.
